            This will be a quick a dirty progression the steps I used (well at least from what I can remember).
            I was driving back from Brewster and saw this beauty sitting off in a field:
            <img src="20131220_120902.jpg"/>
            And I thought I wanted to drag it home, but I already had too many car projects sitting in the backyard
            and the wife may not like another. So I took lots of Pics, when I got home, I decided I'd like to paint 
            that. I started off with a basic pencil outline and started working on gray and black tones for the base 
            paint.

            Color is a slow process with me. Too much at one time and you might as well throw it out, so light layers 
            building a little at a time.

            <img src="20140217_212421.jpg"/>
            <img src="20140218_212324.jpg"/>
            <img src="20140223_212233.jpg"/>
            <img src="20140314_102031.jpg"/>
            And then a final digital border cleanup and removing the cameria's light reflection:

            I know I have a write up on paints and resources I used, I just have to find it, and when I do, I'll 
            post it here.
