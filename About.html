            I grew up a Radio Shack nerd, always tearing old radios and TV's appart
            where ever I could find them for parts, but this was ballaned out with 
            rebuilding dirt bikes and later on old cars. When I hit middle school, I 
            became enamered with the Apple IIe lab. Oh sure, I played Oregan Trail in 
            grade shool, but It didn't click till I found the prgramming Basic pamflet 
            stuffed in the back of a cubboard, it opened a whole new world and got me sent
            to the princibles office after the whole computer lab was flashing: "Keyboard 
            class is dull" (okay that was not the actuall wordage).
        </p>
        <p>
            Software development continued thrugh highschool, where my wonderfull counceler
            got me convinced that software development did not have a future, so I moved on
            to autobody, got married, started having kids and then the body shop shut down
            leaving me out of work. Wahoo, I'm poor with a kid on the way; (mostly) free ride to 
            college for retraining, yay!
        </p>
        <p>
            That year got my first hand me down 486 compaq desktop computer with 16mb of RAM (wow) 
            when starting Yakima Valley Community College. I instantly glommed onto software
            development in my general CS degree. In my first year I was doing work study in the
            IT department. I was headded up by Peggy Keller, who ultimately got me my start 
            in software development. 
        </p>
        <P>
            The college had an issue with student tracking in the computer labs; it was all
            done on paper with no real way to figure out actual usage. Peggy allowed me to
            dig up a surplused 486 laptop out of the basement and load it up with Visual Basic 4?
            maybe 5? I built something in a few weeks and the college was happy with it and
            got my first check for the sale of the program. I found my nitche.

            At the sametime Douglas Nielson one of my programming teachers, did work on the side
            for an industrial refergeration control company: Doubl-Kold, but they ran into an
            issue where they were 3 months behind schedule, and Douglas couldn't help, so 
            he sent me over. Doubl-Kold showed me the issues they were having in making a 
            hybred Windows HMI with a DOS control computer. I had them caught up in around 
            three hours and got hired on the spot. Needless to say, I meant to finsh my degree, 
            but the work schedule never permitted it.   
        </p>
        <p>
            I was at Doubl-Kold for nearly 18 years, and except for the first few years; basically the 
            only developer. Unfortunatly due to NDA I can not show anything about this software That
            was built and maintained over the course of my stay. But I can describe some details about it:
            <br/>
            When I first started the prevous developer had been building everything in DOS, and had 
            a very static C program, this resulted in 131 different versions of almost the same program. This software
            was responsible for talking to remote IO over RS422 serial communications and regulating
            the CA rooms temperature and atmosphere along with numerus other functions. The unfortuant part
            was each apple warehouse is slightly different in how it's controlled, causing mulpitle varations
            of the same code.
            <br/>
            When I was able to take a crack at it, my first mission was to bump it into DotNet, and use
            and XML file to dynamically change how each facility would operate. Honistly the ins and outs
            for this design could take up pages, and I may someday devote a special page on this site
            for control design, but not here. The program revolved around reading in an XML file on load
            to get information on IO and control configuraiton for a single facility. This was helped 
            by a little program that allowed someone trained on it to assemble a facility in just a couple
            hours, insted of weeks. All this allowed me to only need to support one verion of the software,
            and give a clear path for upgradding facilitys along the way to keep them with the latest 
            version. The only difference between a Zirkle Fruit facility and a Stemilt facility was a 
            single XML file, that stayed fairly static over the course of upgrades.
            <br/>
            The other big component was the HMI that allowed an end user to customize how the program
            looked and what data was shown on what screen and did they want a data tag to look like text 
            or a gauge or maybe a reader board. I learned long ago you can't make everyone happy with UI
            layout, but if users are given the power to manipulate what it looks like, you get a much
            happier base. I've also determined that the simplier the interface, the less it scares of potental 
            users from exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sadly near the end of my stay, I found the work way too repeatitive, as there was nothing new the 
            base software couldn't take on. I also felt stagnated, as the job wasn't pushing me to grow as 
            a developer. I spent six months documenting every aspect of my duties and all the tooling
            built over the years. Since the software didn't require changes for Doubl-Kold to continue selling
            and installing new facilities, I felt that I left them in a good position, and would allow them
            time to find a new developer.
        </p>

            I moved on to Van Doren Sales that buils Fruit Pack house equipment (I know, still sort of the
            same industry, and many of the same people). It was a bit of a shock to the system that I needed
            I quickly added a bunch of new skills needed for the job: Web development, Android Applications, 
            Linux with Java application, some embedded Ada, Rest services, Document based Databases like MongoDB,
            and a push to use WPF (I still don't like, but it'sale what the shop uses so...)
            <br/>
            This is also another situation that NDA's come into play. But one of the most noticable system
            features is our display system that uses a central web server like IIS running an ASP.net to
            deliver constant updated dashboards through out the packlines. What's really cool about it, is using
            those cheep $35 Raspberry Pi computers as a source to dish the webpages to the TV stations. This setup
            makes it very inexpensive to implemt a large collection of what ammounts to kisoks. 
            <br/>
            Something I was excided to implemnt were Raspberry Pi/Linux based interactive stations that workers could use
            to send print commands to the server, and get basic information about what they were packing.
        </p>

            I've not slacked off on my personal projects. I try to keep them completly seperate from work, this 
            sometimes tend to be difficult as there are lots of crossover in what I enjoy working on, but checkout
            my personal projects page. Since this site is likely to be under constant development, I'll post new content
            whenever possible.
