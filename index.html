          <b>Hi</b>, anyone who lands here, this small site is for 
          anything I’m working on that I’d like to share.
        </P>
        <p>
          Professionally; I’m a software developer who used to specialize in
          industrial control and embedded systems, but I’ve branched out to
          become an all-around developer that includes web, desktop, and
          platforms like Android. Currently C#/VB.net, JavaScript Are my goto
          languages, I've also jumped into Java, C, Ada, but increasingly Rust
          has piqued my interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a few blogs out there that have mostly gone un-updated :
          <a href="http://mattisoverlydistracted.blogspot.com/"
            >MattIsOverlyDistracted</a
          >
          showing a variety of things I’ve worked on and later came
          <a href="http://rustmotorcycles.blogspot.com/">Rust Motorcycles</a>
          that I do plan to get back to when my schedule get’s cleaned up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a varied amount of personal hobbies that I feel make me a more
          rounded person: welding, wood working, sewing, electronics design,
          autobody, brewing, cooking, airbrushing, digital art (gimp),
          gardening, camping, novel writing rat-rods and motorcycles and more.
          Unfortunately, my time is limited, so I usually choose projects that
          will fit within a short amount of time.
        </p>
