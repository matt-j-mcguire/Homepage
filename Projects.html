            A small portion of my projects are stored up on 
            <a href="https://github.com/matt-j-mcguire" target="_blank">GitHub.</a> I feel these projects have
            some merrit, to be at least stored in the public. By all means download the code and use it if you
            find it usefull to you, just mention where you got it somewhere in your source code if you don't mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I find time I'll help other devs over at <a href="CodeProject.com" target="_blank">CodeProject.com</a>.
            I've publish <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=4853066" target="_blank">
            a few articles there.</a> It's much more work than I would have origonaly thought, but the peer review is welcomed, 
            and I've been known to go back re-edit something posted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually I'll get some descriptions of the uploaded projects here, with tutorials if I can.
